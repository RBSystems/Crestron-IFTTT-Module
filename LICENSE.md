The IFTTT interface module provides for bi-directional communication with ifttt.com (if-this-then-that).   With this module you can, for example, control your Crestron system using voice commands on an Amazon Echo.  You can also, for example, send emails or text messages based on events occurring in the Crestron system.  You can also get data from, or control, a wealth of IoT devices.  

The module is written in Simpl# and this download includes an example program demonstrating its use as well as detailed help files.

This module is released as shareware.  As a developer the module is free for use on your own personal Crestron system.  However, if you decide to use it on customer systems where you, or the dealer/csp you work for will profit from it than I ask for a single payment of $100.  

What you get is 

1) My thanks
2) Permission to use the module on as many client projects as you want
3) A copy of the Simpl# source code for the module (only a binary executable is included with the example program)
4) Good Karma

You can contact me at jay.m.basen@gmail.com to arrange for payment.

Thanks

Jay Basen
